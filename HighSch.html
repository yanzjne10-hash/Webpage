	<p><b>During our school’s Chinese Spring Festival event, we joined several<br>
	contests, including the Chinese dubbing competition where we won 2nd<br>
	place! It was such a fun and exciting experience, and all the days we<br>
	spent preparing were definitely worth it.</b></p><br>

	<p><b>I was chosen to represent our school in the Division Festival of Talents<br>
	under the Mandarin Lingo Stars category. I portrayed Mulan and<br>
	recited famous lines highlighting her characteristics. The preparation<br>
	was stressful, tiring, and challenging, but it was also exciting and<br>
	truly rewarding. All the hard work paid off as I won 1st place for our school.</b></p><br>

	<p><b>After the Division Festival of Talents came the Regional Festival of Talents,<br>
	which was held in Parañaque. It was such a nerve-wracking experience<br>
	to represent our school at this level. Although I didn’t win 1st place, I’m still<br>
	proud of my performance because I gave my best, and earning 2nd place<br>
	was already a great achievement.</b></p><br>

	<p><b>Our JS Prom was such an exciting and memorable event. I was enthusiastic<br>
	about it, and we all had so much fun enjoying our time together. It felt<br> 
	even more special knowing that these were some of our last moments as<br>
	a section, since our moving up is near and some of us will soon be<br>
	taking different courses or even transferring to other schools.</b></p><br>

	<p><b>Our Moving Up ceremony finally came, and it was truly a moment of mixed<br>
	emotions, both happy and sad. We were excited to reach this milestone, but at<br>
	the same time, it was hard to accept that our section would no longer be the<br>
	same. We had been together for so many years, and we had grown so used to<br>
	each other that it felt different and bittersweet to part ways.</b></p><br>

	<p><b>This is me with my best friend. I felt both joyful and sad that day, we<br>
	finally moved up to become senior high students, but she will be transferring<br>
	to another school, which means I won’t get to see and talk to her every day<br> 
	anymore. It made me quite nostalgic, yet I was still proud of us because<br>
	we both received two awards that day.</b></p><br>

	<p><b>This was our work immersion, and I was assigned to my former elementary<br>
	school, which made the experience very memorable. I was placed in the office,<br>
	where we helped the principal's assistant in organizing the canteen pricing<br>
	and school documents. Everyone I worked with was very friendly and did a great<br>
	job, making the experience even better. It was both fun and meaningful, especially<br>
	since we were also given with free food. The place and the teachers felt very<br>
	familiar, some still remember me even after all those years.</b></p></br>

<img src=rp.jpg width=250px>
	<p><b>In our 21st Century activity, my partner and I cosplayed as Frieren and<br> 
	Himmel from the anime Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End. It was such a fun and<br>
	creative experience that allowed us to bring the characters to life.</b></p></br>

	<p><b>This was our Christmas party at school with the theme ‘Disco Ball.’ We<br>
	had so much fun playing games, dancing, and simply enjoying our<br>
	time together. After the party, we went to a friend’s house where we<br>
	continued the celebration with more activities, laughter, and moments<br>
	to treasure. Later that night, we decided to go Christmas caroling, singing in<br>
	front of many houses and receiving generous amounts of money in return. It<br>
	was such a joyful and memorable experience, filled with music, laughter, and<br>
	togetherness. We were truly grateful for that night, it was a special Christmas<br> 
	day that we will always cherish.</b></p></br>

	<p><b>Our research journey was full of stress and challenges, but in the end,<br>
	it was all worth it. We even gathered at a friend’s condo to work together, and<br>
	at our group mate's house to conduct our experiment. There were many late<br>
	nights spent finishing the paper and the experiment, but the teamwork made<br> 
	the experience memorable. It taught us the value of patience, cooperation,<br> 
	and hardwork.</b></p></br>

	<p><b>During our Grad Ball, I was chosen as a candidate for Ms. Queen of the<br>
	Night. To my surprise, I even made it to the Top 5, which was something<br>
	I honestly didn’t expect. Although I didn’t win, the experience was<br>
	unforgettable, I was nervous at first, but I still had so much fun<br>
	dancing and laughing with my friends. It was definitely a night to<br>
	remember and a perfect way to celebrate our journey together.</b></p></br>

	<p><b>This is our whole class, taken during our graduation practice. It made us<br>
	realize that our senior high school days are almost over. With college just<br>
	around the corner, we were already busy applying to different universities.<br>
	Around this time, we were also planning our bonding outside school and our<br>
	graduation celebration with our circle of friends. It was a bittersweet<br>
	reminder that a new chapter is about to begin.</b></p></br>

<img src="moments.jpg" width=250px>
	<p><b>Just after our graduation, we also celebrated our friend’s birthday along<br>
	with our graduation. We shared a feast, sang karaoke, went swimming, and<br>
	had late night talks together. Some of us even cried when the celebration<br>
	ended and it was time to go home, since many of us had known each other<br>
	for years. That day was truly nostalgic and memorable, it felt special because<br> 
	it was our last complete moment together before moving on to college and<br>
	the busy life ahead.</b></p></br>
