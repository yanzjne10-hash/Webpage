	<p><b>This is me with my best friend on our first day of college. I was so glad<br> 
	and excited that after two years, we were finally studying at the<br>
	same school again. We toured around the campus together, exploring<br> 
	every corner and familiarizing ourselves with the place.<br> 
	It felt comforting to know that I wasn’t alone on this new journey,<br> 
	and I am really grateful to have her by my side. We're just so<br>
	inseparable.</b></p><br>

	<p><b>These are my classmates whom I got to know during the first weeks<br>
	of college. Day by day, we’re learning more about each other and slowly<br>
	becoming friends as we hang out, talk, and share moments together<br>
	both during and after class.</b></p><br>

	<p><b>This was during the General Assembly of the (CAS) College of Arts and<br>
	Sciences. We had a lot of fun playing games and actively participating in the<br>
	activities. Upon entering, we were given freebies, which added to the<br>
	excitement. Overall, it was a fun and enjoyable experience that made the event<br>
	truly memorable.</b></p><br>

	<p><b>This was during Ignite, the welcoming event for freshmen. Every performance<br>
	was amazing, especially when artists Maven and Angela Ken performed. Afterward<br>
	came the raffle draw. At the very end, the grand prize was announced—and to my<br>
	surprise, my student number was called! I honestly didn’t expect to win the Instax,<br>
	especially since we were about to go home but couldn’t leave because the way was<br>
	blocked. Staying until the end turned out to be worth it. I was shocked at first,<br>
	then I came running to the stage to claim the prize. I felt so grateful that day!”</b></p><br>

	<p><b>We really struggled to explore Intramuros because the rain suddenly poured<br>
	heavily. We had to look for shelter, but since it lasted for quite a<br>
	while, we ended up getting soaked. Eventually, we all agreed to stay at<br>
	the Lego Museum for a while. On the way there, we shared umbrellas with each<br>
	other, which made the experience more fun despite the hassle. In the end, it<br>
	was all worth it because so many memorable moments happened, it even helped<br>
	our section bond quickly, even though we weren’t that close yet. The only<br>
	downside was that our feet were aching by the time we were about to go home,<br>
	since we all walked for too long.</b></p><br>

	<p><b>We were invited to celebrate our classmate’s birthday, and it turned out<br>
	to be such a fun and memorable day. We took lots of group photos, shared<br>
	laughter, and enjoyed every moment together. What made it even more special<br>
	was the bond we created that day, it wasn’t just about celebrating a birthday,<br>
	but also about making memories as classmates and friends.</b></p><br>

<img src=billiards.jpg width=250px>
	<p><b>We once again went out as a group to play billiards at Fishermall. Afterwards,<br>
	some of us also tried the bumper cars, and we even planned to go for KTV.<br>
	Unfortunately, we couldn’t all fit inside the rooms, so we decided to head home<br>
	instead. Still, it was a fun experience overall, and it made me happy that our<br>
	section has already gone on so many trips together even if it can be a little<br>
	expensive at times.</b></p><br>
