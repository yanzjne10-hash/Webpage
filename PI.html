<b><h3>Personal Information</h3></b>

		Hey there!🤗 I’m Allana Jane M. Togonon, I’m 17 years old and was born on November 10, 2007 at Olongapo City, Zambales. 
		I was raised and started school here in Manila. Currently, I am a first-year student at Manila Central University, 
		taking up Computer Science and I graduated high school at San Francisco High School under the STEM strand of the Academic Track.
<br><br>
		Ever since, I’ve wanted to improve my computer literacy and have always been curious about technology, which is why I chose this course. 
		I’m passionate about learning programming and exploring how computers work. Although I sometimes find it intimidating and confusing, 
		I’m excited to keep learning and improving every day.
<br><br>
		I haven’t worked on personal projects yet aside from school activities, but lately I’ve been finding coding interesting and fun to do. 
		Even though it can be frustrating at times as a beginner, I see it as part of the learning process, and it motivates me to grow further.
